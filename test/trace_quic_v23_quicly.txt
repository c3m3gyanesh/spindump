A test between Picoquic client and the Fastly "Quicly" implementation. There were two tests (plain QUIC and HTTP23), but the server was not responding on the latter. The commands used were:

    ./picoquic/picoquicdemo -l ./test.log -L -a "hq-23" -v ff000017 quic.examp1e.net 4433 /5000
    ./picoquic/picoquicdemo -l ./test.log -L -a "h3-23" -v ff000017 h2o.examp1e.net 8443 /5000
